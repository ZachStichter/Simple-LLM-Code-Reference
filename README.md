# Simple-LLM-Code-Reference
A simple interactive code reference using either Gemini or Ollama.

Uses Google Gemini (default) or a local instance of Mistral downloaded through Ollama.

Quick Start:

- Have Python installed on your computer
- Have a Google Gemini API key
- OR
- Have Ollama installed on your computer (configured for Windows only)
- Edit temp.env.secret to include either the Gemini API key or Ollama installation directory (or both) and rename it to .env.secret

After these requirements are met, download the repository and run main.py
It should be that simple.
